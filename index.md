On 12th May 2017 I will be 40 years old. To help me get over this terrible event I'm going to undertake 6 crowd-sourced challenges in the
preceding months.

But first a history lesson...

# Turning 30

Back in 2006 and 2007, to make turning 30 more bearable (seems trivial when you're about to hit 40) I asked people to suggest
6 challenges for me to undertake in the 6 months preceding the birthday.

People suggested all kinds of activities ranging from bog snorkelling to donating bone marrow.
In the end I picked these challenges:

1. [Run around a castle in your underwear](http://richoramablog.blogspot.co.uk/2006/11/things-to-de-before-youre-30-task-1.html)
1. [Make a short film](http://richoramablog.blogspot.co.uk/2006/12/things-to-do-before-youre-30-task-2.html)
1. [Go down the deepest cave, and up the highest mountain in England](http://richoramablog.blogspot.co.uk/2007/01/things-to-do-before-youre-30-task-3.html)
1. [Go to a party with an outfit costing less than Â£5](http://richoramablog.blogspot.co.uk/2007/02/things-to-do-before-youre-30-task-4_25.html)
1. [Run between Kenilworth and Warwick Castles](http://richoramablog.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/castle-run-video.html)
1. [Scale the Sydney Harbour Bridge](http://richoramablog.blogspot.co.uk/2007/04/things-to-do-before-youre-30-task-6.html)

# Turning 40

Now I'm turning 40 I'm going to do another 6 challenges. But what should I do? I'd like you to come up with the ideas.

The easiest way to contribute an idea is to [add an issue](https://github.com/richorama/40/issues) in the GitHub repo or add a comment below.
